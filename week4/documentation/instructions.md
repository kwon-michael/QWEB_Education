## What is React?

* React is a JavaScript library (a piece of code which can be reused across projects) for building user interfaces and web applications.
* It uses languages such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, JSX, and more.
* The learning curve for React is very close to linear, you can use as much or as little as you need which makes it perfect for scaling your projects.

# Getting started

## Creating a React app

We'll use a tool called `npx` to generate a barebones React project for us, into a folder named `project-name` (you may want to change it!).

```terminal
npx create-react-app project-name
cd project-name
```

Inside your terminal you are now inside your project directory, to start your app all you have to do is the following command:

```terminal
npm start
```

In a few seconds, a tab in your web browser will pop up and your project will be waiting for you there. Your website should automatically update on file changes.
You can exit the command with CTRL + C.
